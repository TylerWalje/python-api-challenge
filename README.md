# python-api-challenge
IMPORTANT NOTE:
  I had some issues with my API Keys being blocked for exceeding the "calls per minute limit". This morning with a tutor, I re-generated the key for OpenWeather and was able to use my existing key for Geoapify. Both scripts were able to run correctly, so both API Keys should work fine. Per the instructions of my tutor, however, they said to inform you (the grader) of this and make you aware that there is a chance you will need to create your own API key(s) to run this script. Again, I doubt this will be the case since both keys worked fine this morning. 

  Thank you.
